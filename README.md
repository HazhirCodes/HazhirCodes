# 👋 Hey, I'm Hazhir

- 🧑‍💻 Fullstack developer with years of building, learning, and experimenting  
- 🛠️ Currently focused on sharpening my skills with Laravel, React, and everything in between  
- 🎯 Obsessed with clean code, solving real problems and providing my own explantion on them
- 🧩 I’ve had multiple GitHub accounts, private repos, and a few side quests — now I’m trying to bring it all together here  
- 🗃️ This is where I centralize, organize, and commit (pun intended)

⚡ Fun fact: My first website said “under construction” for nearly a full year… because I forgot to update the index page.
